# Prion-in-solvents-2023
This is a Bachelor's Degree project aiming to simulate human prion protein in the Amber03 force field in four different solvents (tip4p water, 10.5M water-urea, ethanol, and benzene) with the aid of the [GROMACS free open-source software](https://www.gromacs.org/) (version 2023). The files in this repository contains the commands used to create a solvent not included in the GROMACS force fields, perform equilibration and a simulation run on a protein in such a solvent, and an example of how to analyze the result. 

Of especially great help to this project (beyond the obvious GROMACS software) has been the [Introduction to Molecular Dynamics](https://tutorials.gromacs.org/md-intro-tutorial.html) jupyter notebook written by Alessandra Villa (who in turn based it on tutorial by Justin Lemkhul), and the [ACPYPE software](https://github.com/alanwilter/acpype) written by Alan Silva.  


This project was written and carried out by Elsa Berlin, Melina Erikson, Sofia Hong, and Sebastian Tell.
