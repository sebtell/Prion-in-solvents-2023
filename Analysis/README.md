The four notebooks above perform analysis on their relevant prion protein solvent simulation, and saves figures in the *results* folder. All *!gmx* commands used and the explanation of their purpose can be found in the [GROMACS manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/cmdline.html). 
If you wish to use these commands directly in a terminal then do mind the **print** prompts. Many gmx commands require further input and this is a workaround for performing the simulation in a jupyter notebook format.

# The analyses performed are, in order of appearance:
1 Root Mean Square Deviation (gmx rms)
2 Radius of Gyration (gmx gyrate)
3 Root Mean Square Fluctation (gmx rmsf)
4 Mean Square Displacement (gmx msd)
5 Solvent Accessible Surface Area (gmx sasa)
